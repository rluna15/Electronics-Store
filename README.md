# Electronics-Store
This was is an only shop website where certain products are on sale based on the day of the week. This was a group project for a project development course. Unfortunelty we ran out of time and we did not get to finish. Some of the code is not is not the best and I wasn't really happy how it turned out since at the time I was learning JavaScript which made it much worse.
